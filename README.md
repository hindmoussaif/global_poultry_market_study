In this repository, we conduct a market analysis of poultry products worldwide to determine the optimal country for a French poultry company to invest in. We employ various clustering algorithms and consider PESTEL criteria to assess market potential. Additionally, we perform a principal component analysis to gain deeper insights into the market dynamics.

By leveraging clustering algorithms, we aim to identify groups of countries with similar market characteristics, such as consumer preferences, regulatory frameworks, economic factors, and technological advancements. This analysis provides a foundation for selecting the most promising market for the expansion of the French poultry company.

Furthermore, the incorporation of PESTEL criteria (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) allows us to evaluate the external factors impacting the poultry industry in each country. This holistic approach enables us to make informed decisions regarding market attractiveness, potential risks, and investment opportunities.

Additionally, we employ a principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data and uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the global poultry market. This analysis aids in understanding the key drivers shaping the industry landscape and supports strategic decision-making.
